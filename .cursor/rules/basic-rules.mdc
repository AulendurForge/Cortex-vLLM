Always take a senior engineer approach to solving problems. Don't take shortcuts and don't create hacks and workarounds that just lead to tech-debt later on.

Make sure to implement robust code in the sense that you account for common error handling. 

Use context7 and web search liberally to make sure you understand the latest documentation and implementation tactics and strategies for excellent code implementation to meet our objectives.

For context7, resolve-library-id will help you identify the most fitting library documentation with the descriptions of libraries, and get-library-docs will allow you to then use those tools to fetch the documentation itself. Use these liberally!

Make sure that the code implementations are using best practices for simple and modular code bases, not expansive and cumbersome code files that start to become hard to track and can easily create hard to trace conflicts and other issues. This also means that you should keep a clean organizations structure to the project, with clear directories across the front and backend of the codebase.

When working frontend, user feedback is key, where the frontend should be providing status and job updates to the user. keep this in mind to make sure that how this information is wired from the frontend to the backnd is correctly implemented, well thought out, and robust.
